Documents published as part of a website share navigational elements, rendering options, and visual style.\nWebsite navigation can be provided through a global navbar, a sidebar with links, or a combination of both for sites that have multiple levels of content. You can also enable full text search for websites.\nQuarto websites can be published to a wide variety of destinations including GitHub Pages, Netlify, Posit Connect, or any other static hosting service or intranet web server. See the documentation on Publishing Websites for additional details."

    "text": "Workflow\nAbove we have demonstrated how to create and edit a simple website. In this section we go into more depth on website workflow.\n\nConfig File\nEvery website has a _quarto.yml config file that provides website options as well as defaults for HTML documents created within the site. For example, here is the default config file for the simple site created above:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"today\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\nSee the documentation on Website Navigation and Website Tools for additional details on website configuration. See HTML Documents for details on customizing HTML format options.\n\n\nWebsite Preview\nIf you are using VS Code or RStudio, the Render button automatically renders and runs quarto preview in an embedded window. You can also do the same thing from the Terminal if need be:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n# preview the website in the current directory\nquarto preview\n\nNote that when you preview a site (either using VS Code / RStudio integrated tools or from the terminal) changes to configuration files (e.g. _quarto.yml) as well as site resources (e.g. theme or CSS files) will cause an automatic refresh of the preview.\nYou can customize the behavior of the preview server (port, whether it opens a browser, etc.) using command line options or the _quarto.yml config file. See quarto preview help or the project file reference for additional details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs you preview your site, pages will be rendered and updated. However, if you make changes to global options (e.g. _quarto.yml or included files) you need to fully re-render your site to have all of the changes reflected. Consequently, you should always fully quarto render your site before deploying it, even if you have already previewed changes to some pages with the preview server.\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Render\nTo render (but not preview) a website, use the quarto render command, which will render the website into the _site directory by default:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n# render the website in the current directory\nquarto render \n\nSee the Project Basics article to learn more about working with projects, including specifying an explicit list of files to render, as well as adding custom pre and post render scripts to your project."

    "section": "Linking",
    "text": "Linking\nWhen creating links between pages in your site, you can provide the source file as the link target (rather than the .html file). You can also add hash identifiers (#) to the source file if you want to link to a particular section in the document. For example:\n[about](about.qmd)\n[about](about.qmd#section)\nOne benefit of using this style of link as opposed to targeting .html files directly is that if you at some point convert your site to a book the file-based links will automatically resolve to section links for formats that produce a single file (e.g. PDF or MS Word)."
